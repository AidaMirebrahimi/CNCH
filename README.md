# CNCH
Workshop codes:
As a Mentor in Cognitive Neurosciece Competition for Highschool (CNCH), I designed these experiment codes as a tool to teach MATLAB and psychtoolbox programming to CNCH participants in workshops.

Assignments:
The assignments that I designed for these workshops so that the students can practice their recently gained knowledge trough hands-on projects. These assignments are designed considering the level-of the students. Besides, these aim to motivate the students by getting interesting results and, yet give them a chance to practically implement what they have learned. Therefore, most parts of the code, except for parts that where taught in the class, where written by me and the students had to complete the code and the algorithm by writing several lines of code.
